                <p>
                    A generalist by training<sup>1</sup>, I do my best work when faced with complex problems. Particularly those that demand bringing together a diversity of discilpinary perspectives.
                    <br><br>
                    I have a slight quantitative leaning, having excelled academically at data science and worked as <i>Data and Insights Officer</i> at Winning Scotland.
                    <br><br>
                    Intellectual pursuits aside, I very much enjoy cooking (and eating), as well as watching professional Counter-Strike.
                    <br><br>
                    <small>1. I graduated in 2024 with First Class Honours in Interdisciplinary Problems and Methods.</small>

                <p>
                    As a data scientist, I focus on transforming data into actionable insights that can drive meaningful change. My expertise spans various fields, from predictive modelling to public health analytics. For example, I developed a model to predict the outcomes of Counter-Strike duels using data collected just before each duel. This project highlights how data science can enhance understanding and strategy in competitive gaming.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to my work in gaming analytics, I have contributed to public health projects, such as analysing data for the Scottish Minister for Drugs and Alcohol Policy. Through the Planet Youth initiative, I helped identify key factors affecting young Scots' drug use. Our analysis revealed that parental disapproval is a crucial predictor, offering valuable insights for shaping effective policies.
                    <br><br>
                    These experiences demonstrate my ability to apply advanced data techniques across diverse domains, showcasing the versatility and impact of data science in tackling complex challenges.

                <p>
                    The #LetThemPlay campaign was dedicated to promoting inclusivity in board gaming by advocating for gender-fair language in game rulebooks. Our efforts have reached over 25,000 impressions and inspired more than 1,000 unique online comments about inclusivity. Through a successful petition, we influenced Days of Wonder to commit to changing their language practices, ensuring that none of their games will continue to default to male pronouns.
                    <br><br>
                    This campaign was born out of the recognition that, despite women making up a significant portion of board game players, they are often overlooked by designers and publishers. Our research highlighted that many popular games predominantly feature male-centric language and imagery.
                    <br><br>
                    We engaged with our community through forums and social media, fostering discussions and building support. By collaborating with influential figures like Elizabeth Hargrave, we were able to make our desired change and call the campaign a success.

                <p>
                    My work in analysis spans diverse areas, from evaluating national policies to tackling complex environmental issues. A notable example is my research on Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) policy, where I examined its impact on promoting ethical business practices and reducing negative externalities such as CO2 emissions. This study combined discourse and regression analyses, providing insights into how policies can balance economic growth with social and environmental well-being.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to this, I have contributed to reviewing energy policy in the UK, focusing on the green transition. Using ODEs, I analysed the potential impacts of various energy strategies, assessing their feasibility and effectiveness in reducing carbon footprints and promoting sustainability.
                    <br><br>
                    These projects reflect my ability to apply analytical techniques across different domains, demonstrating how thoughtful analysis can inform policy decisions and drive sustainable development.
